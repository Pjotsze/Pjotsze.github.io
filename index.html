            <p> Here you can see how much does increasing/decreasing your defence will effect the dmg you take.</p>
            <p> The way it works is: </p> 
            <p> STEP 1: Give your actual defence and the dmg you take. it can be some real example like
                how much dmg you took from elemental leader aoe, but you could also give some arbirtrary number, say: 10.000,
                just to see the effect procentage wise.
            </p>
            <p>
                STEP 2: Look how the dmg you take changes when you change your defence value
            </p>
            <p>
                STEP 3: Click the button to create visualization for the values given in step 1 <br />
                Y-axis shows hp values, X-axis shows defence values.
                It creates 2d plane with various combination of (hp, defence) values. The red area are the (hp, defence) values where you would die from given attack. The green area is where you would survive the attack <br />
                You can also see the exact hp/defence values in this 2d plane by hovering over it with a mouse cursor or by clicking on it (mobile).
